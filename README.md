# IPFC-documentation

Welcome to InterPlanetary Flash Cards, one of the learning apps in a suite of apps hosted by EduVault. Eduvault is a next generation educational technology organization that prioritizes student ownership of their data and data portability across platforms. Eduvault uses the InterPlanetary File System to store data, allowing it to work in a decentralized manner and using peer to peer connections.

InterPlanetary Flash Cards is the brainchild of Jacob Rosenthal-Cohen, an educator and polymath. It is advised by Brian Schwartz, who has extensive experience in blockchain technology and education, and built out with the help of Monica Kumaran, another polymath starting her career as a programmer, artist, and educator.

Here are links and pictures of the team:

To use IPFC, download the FireFox or Chrome extension off the extension store and sign up using one of your primary emails. You will automatically get 1GB of storage from Pinata, an IPFS file pinning service, to store flashcards you make, and the ability to highlight any part of any webpage you visit or borrow images and use those to make flashcards.

You can customize decks, group them by subject, send them to friends based on username (pending feature), and take advantage of the Spaced Repetition (SRS) learning algorithm for memorizing key concepts in subjects ranging from human anatomy to programming.

EduVault also sponsors plugins to import/export flashcard information into Quizlet, Trello, Anki, and VSCode.
 
If you wish to support the project financially or make a feature request, feel free to open an issue on the IPFC-documentation repo.

Happy EduVaulting!
